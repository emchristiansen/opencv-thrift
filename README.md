#OpenCV-Thrift
This is a hand-written wrapper / RPC interface to [OpenCV](https://github.com/Itseez/opencv) using [Apache Thrift](https://github.com/apache/thrift).
It should make it easy to call OpenCV from [any one of a number of languages](http://thrift.apache.org/docs/features/), including: C++, C#, Cocoa, D, Delphi, Erlang, Haskell, Java, OCaml, Perl, PHP, Python, Ruby, and Smalltalk.
It also provides an RPC mechanism, for making function calls across network connections.

##Getting started


The installed version of the project should probably be renamed to OpenCVThrift to avoid naming conflicts with OpenCV itself.
